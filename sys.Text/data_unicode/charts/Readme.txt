The Unicode Standard, Version 17.0 - Code Charts

The file "CodeCharts.pdf" contains all of the final code charts for
Unicode 17.0. Warning: this file is over 100 megabytes.
The charts in CodeCharts.pdf do not highlight the new characters.

Fonts

The shapes of the reference glyphs used in the Unicode Code Charts are not
prescriptive. Considerable variation is to be expected in actual fonts.
The particular fonts used in these charts were provided to the Unicode
Consortium by a number of different font designers, who own the rights
to the fonts. See https://www.unicode.org/charts/fonts.html for a list.
